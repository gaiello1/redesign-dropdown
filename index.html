          <td>There is no down arrow next to the time but it is boxed in some states.
             In another state it does not seem like a drop down arrow will appear 
             when you click on the time. However, to change the time you can click 
             on a different time block in the calendar.</td>
          <td>There is a down arrow next to the paragraph styles that makes it known 
            that there will be a drop down menu.</td>
          <td>There is a down arrow that makes it known that there will be a drop 
            down menu if you want to select a genre.</td>

          <th>Keyboard</th>

             it moves through the options.
            When the menu is pressed and you press the escape key, the menu closes.
            </td>
          <td>When you click on the “Paragraph Styles” dropdown menu and move the up 
            and down arrows it moves the document instead of scrolling through the menu.
            When the menu is pressed and you press the escape key, the menu closes.
            </td>
          <td>When you click on the “Genres” dropdown menu and move the up and down arrows 
            it moves the webpage instead of scrolling through the menu.
            When the menu is pressed and you press the escape key, the menu does not close.

          <th>Touch (if available)</th>
          <td>You can also change the time of your event on the app by more precisely 
            changing the size of the box that is on the calendar.</td>
          <td>While you are typing, a bar on top of the keyboard comes up where you 
            can edit the text like bold/ how it is aligned/ italicized/ and also how 
            the text is styled.</td>
          <td>There isn’t the same menu on the mobile version. There is a “TV Shows” 
            and “Movies” option, then “Category”.</td>

      <h2>Output:</h2>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Hovering</th>
          <td>When you hover over the time, the box becomes a shade darker making it 
            look clickable. It also has a line underneath it depending on the state it was previously in.</td>
          <td>Nothing changes when you hover over the box.</td>
          <td>When you hover over the “Genres” box, it becomes transparent.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>VoiceOver</th>
          <td>When using VoiceOver, “9:15pm, Start time, menu pop up collapsed, combo box” when the start time 
            is clicked, “10:15pm, End time, menu pop up expanded, combo box, Event, tab panel” when the end time is selected.
            </td>
          <td>When the application opens, the VoiceOver begins by reading the document, which isn’t the best. I tried clicking
             around the edit text option to prompt it to read the options, and it did not. After I clicked the “Paragraph Styles”
              option, the VoiceOver read “3 items Paragraph Styles”. This was not the most accessible because there are so many 
              options to click on the page and it would be hard to know where this option was. 
            </td>
          <td>When you enter the Netflix website, the VoiceOver starts by reading the top menu bar from left to right. Then it 
            moves to the line below the menu bar and reads after the “Movies” option “Genres, menu pop up collapsed, button”. 
            This seemed like the most accessible since the user might not know where this option is.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Cue to click/ Appearence</th>
          <td>The time does not look clickable, it is in a smaller font and there is no box around it. I think one has to be told 
            this to know it unless they try tapping all over the screen, but after that it is easy to remember.
          </td>
          <td>You have to click on the Paragraph Styles Icon, which is not labelled, to pull up the menu. I think one has to be 
            told this to know it, but after that it is easy to remember.
            <div><img class="smallImage" src="./assets/paragraph.png"/></div>
          </td>
          <td>When you click on “Genres” a box is displayed with your selected choice. Then another menu comes up, “Category”. 
            This was the most intuitive out of the three applications.</td>

        <div><img class="galleryImage" src="./assets/state3.png"/></div>

      <div id="intro">
        <p>I am choosing to make selecting the menu more dramatic by having a focused state when it is hovered over. 
          When the dropdown menu is selected, it will look pressed. When the menu is hovered on, the selected item
           will have a red outline and a drop shadow. This increases learnability but may decrease efficiency since 
           t might be distracting from the text on the actual document.</p>
        <p>I added a lot of functionality with the keyboard that was not present initially. Originally, the up and 
          down arrows didn’t control the menu, but the place of the cursor on the document. I changed it so that 
          the arrows control how the menu is scrolled through, which is more beneficial for keyboard users. I am 
          choosing an increase in accessibility even if it makes learnability a little less.</p>

      <h2>Component Redesign- Original vs Redesign</h2>

      <div class="word-container">

        <div><h3>After</h3></div>

      <div class="flex-container">

      <div id="intro">
        <p>I am redesigning the drop down menu from Pages. </p> 
          
        <p>In its initial state, there is a plus sign which 
          shows the menu can be expanded to show options. </p> 

        <p>In the state where the drop down is selected, the 
          drop down looks pressed and the current option is focused with a red outline and a drop shadow. 
          It is improved because the option that the mouse or keyboard is on looks selected. This version 
          of the component affects learnability because wherever your mouse is on the menu is highlighted. 
          This seemed like an obvious choice to make. The user just needs to remember a “+” means the menu 
          can extend which is common in current day apps. 
          
          <p>This will be a big improvement to accessibility 
          for when the keyboard is used. If you are using a keyboard, you will now be able to tab to the 
          paragraph styles drop down, which would be more efficient.</p>

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <p>Netflix did well by making then “Genre” category look different every state it was in. When it was 
          hovered over, it was noticeable which makes it easier to track the cursor. I implemented this feature 
          in my design for another application.</p>
        <p>A text box on the Netflix website was transparent. The text stood out on the page but the text box was 
          not filled, which makes me believe it might be hard to see in some cases. I chose a color that contrasted 
          well with the background so it would stand out.</p>
        <p>Most computer users in my generation are able to track their cursor and have precise control on their
           mouse pad. Pages seems to be designed without others who cannot do this. Pages didn’t indicate if the
            cursor was hovering over an option on the menu. I made this change so the cursor is easier to track. 
            I also made it more visible when the drop down menu was selected.
        </p>
        <p>The VoiceOver function did not work with Pages well for people who needed to use the keyboard only
           because the user couldn’t tab through the drop down menu. The drop down menu on Netflix was more 
           accessible because you could use the arrows to scroll through the list.</p>
        <p>I think people who could use the mouse are most prioritized. This would impact the user experience 
          negatively if someone has limited mobility in their hands.</p>
