          <ul>
            <li>The interface allows people to unlock the door with or without a key</li>
            <li>The buttons turn green when they are pressed and make a noise</li>
            <li>The entry is processed when the lock button is pressed</li>
            <li>If the wrong password is entered → the buttons flash red three times and it beeps three times</li>
            <li>If the right password is entered → the buttons light up green and the door unlocks</li>

      <h2>Here is what I observed...</h2>
      <div id="text">
        <p>Users seem to first check the door to see if it is unlocked. The door handle moves, but the user has to lean into the door to see if it will open. 
          Users who are in a rush are more likely to push harder on the door in this stage.

          Users seem to press the buttons with their right pointer finger or right thumb. When locking the door, some seem to wait until the sound 
          finishes of the door locking to leave, while others trust that the door will lock. I noticed that you can enter as many numbers as you want. 
          Most users enter the code quickly and the button locations represent a pattern.

             locks so the user needs to have a set of keys accessible a few moments prior to unlocking the 
             unit door. But to get into the unit door specifically, the keypad is used.</td>

            unless you try the door, and the same principle applies here.</td>

        <p>I was surprised to find people were relatively satisfied with the interface. This makes sense since
          the keypad lock is popular these days, especially as remote controlled door locks become more 
          common with security systems.</p>
